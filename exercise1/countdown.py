"""
The `async/await` keywords enable cooperative multitasking, but that only
works when functions *cooperate* by using `await` to let the scheduler run
other tasks concurrently.

As an experiment, replace the line labeled `<A>` with this::

    time.sleep(delay)

Save and run the program to see the effect. Discuss with your neighboors and
with the instructor.

A key lesson of this example is that an `async` function which never does
`await` is really synchronous.
